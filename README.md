# LinAlgCPP
A project to code all the knowledge in the University of Waterloo's MATH 115 course (Linear Algebra for Engineering) in C++.

## Introduction
The following numerical structures are taught in MATH 115 at the University of Waterloo:

- Complex numbers
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Subspaces
- Bases

This project aims to provide a class for each structure above that includes their respective properties and theorems as class methods. Operator overloading will also be implemented to introduce concepts like scalar and matrix multiplication.

### A Note About Academic Honesty
The goal of this project is not to build a working product. Rather, it is meant to develop C++ skills and reinforce MATH 115 and MTE 121 concepts to prepare for final exams. With that being said, we do not condone and are not responsible for anyone who aims to use this project for malicious purposes, including but not limited to<sup>[1](#academichonesty)</sup>
